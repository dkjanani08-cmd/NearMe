                the fort. The contrast between greenery / fields and rocky fort walls is striking. 
The fort’s own architecture: the layout of walls, bastions, gates (Pondicherry
 Gate, Arcot Gate), ruins of palaces, granaries, temples, Elephant Tank, and water reservoirs. 
Other hills in the fort complex — seeing how the three hillocks are positioned relative to each other (looks dramatic from some viewpoints). 
Distant features like roads, smaller settlements, possibly forest patches depending on direction and visibility. On clear days, the visibility is quite good.</front>
