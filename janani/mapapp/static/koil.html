                 below are details about the fort complex which hosts several temples:
Gingee Fort is in Villupuram district, Tamil Nadu. Itâ€™s historically very old, with contributions from 
many dynasties including the Cholas, Kadavas, the Vijayanagar Empire, Nayaks, Marathas, Mughals and colonial powers. 
The fort complex is built over three hillocks: Krishnagiri, Rajagiri (Anandagiri), and Chakilidurg. 
Within the fort, there's a temple dedicated to the goddess Chenjiamman.
