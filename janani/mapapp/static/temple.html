                Local tradition holds that the shrine of Senjiamman / Kamalakanni Amman
                 may precede even the fort itself, with its development tracing back to
                  around 1200 CE, when Ananda Kon, a leader of the Konar community (shepherds), 
                  is said to have established early structures in this region. 
                There is an important festival of 10 days held annually for Kamalakanni Amman. 
                Car (chariot) processions are part of the events. 
               In earlier times, sacrificial practices (buffaloes, animals, even
                human heads in symbolic form in stone reliefs) were associated with the shrine, as noted in colonial‚Äêhistorical and local accounts, though many of those practices have ceased. 
                Kamalakanni Amman is one of seven virgin guardian goddesses (seven Kannimar) of 
                 local area; in some versions of the legend she is understood to be the same as or closely identified with Senjiamman
